i think i saw it in the news
he was on his break
just gazing at his shoes
when the camera moves
from dj lance
our jolly orange mc
doesn't "like to dance"
the players in this farce
spread emptiness like a prism
the whole less than its parts
a parade of infantilism
~chorus~
ain't we sad without
our little bitty folksong, shout:
bla bla na na na
fa la la fa la la
oo oo aa aa aa
bla bla fa lala la la
we say we do it all for baby
the mass metamorphosis
from clowns to cinderella gowns
anything to stop the frowns
~bridge~
but too much time in neverland
addles the adult mind,
leaves it grasping for identity
in any blueprint it finds
~chorus~
suggestible to the ad-creative's vice
the impossible archetype's life
bold adventurer, impressive mustache
perfect working mother-wife

when maturity's a curse
we pretend our children come first
but it's we who unbecome our age
and make their growing worse

Legend

there was a time
when i could give you all you wanted
there was a place
where there was nothing 'til we started

there was life and then there was a story we told
in eternal lines to time the trail grew cold
could not trace the paths that led us to that place
looking down upon the human race
together we stood, above it all
smiling at the distant shore, unafraid to fall
like houses on the cliffs, or teeth on a steed
too tall to see the weeds
our story poured from our hearts
an epic struggle to unknown parts
together we braved the wildest seas
this was our legend, you and me

then from beneath, the assumptions, far and wide
between us a wall of tangled regret, an opaque tide
we were soon defenders of a jealous keep
bound and determined at each others' side
so we stayed and played a self-told tale
beseiged by hopes, against them we raged
filled the photos, inscribed the hall
with the deeds that filled our stage
there was a time
when i didn't answer your call
there was a place too full
to let go of it all

you are the power to my heart
the greatest novel, the finest art
the legend is forgotten
this is real, you and me
now is the time
now is the place

upon this paper bag
is printed your name
i got from the chinese takeout
on 24th & 7th and i feel ashamed
the bag carries your credentials, your name
did you assemble it?
did you inspect it?
it left the factory bearing your name
elsewhere on the bag:DURO 8
duro company, largest paper bag manufacturing company in the world
with plants in:
Alsip IL,
Brownsville TX,
Covington KY,
Elizabeth NJ,
Florence KY,
Jackson TN,
Richmond VA,
Rio Bravo MX,
Tolleson AZ,
and Walton KY
so it seems DURO publishes the names of its employees
on the products it sells
and like so many branded cattle, the bags go to pasture
bearing these names, bound for fame
are these meant to be the mark of quality?
are a name and internal identification number
supposed to be a demonstration that this inanimate object
was inspected by a human, making it a better bag than the rest?
is this a way of enforcing quality assurance?
are the name and id a method of identification
in the event that too little glue held the flaps
it might collapse and a customer could complain
to the DURO corporation
and they could dehumanize
and cut you off
and there would be no job to find in:
Alsip IL,
Brownsville TX,
Covington KY,
Elizabeth NJ,
Florence KY,
Jackson TN,
Richmond VA,
Rio Bravo MX,
Tolleson AZ,
or Walton KY
and you would take a bus to NYC, penniless
and you would be begging for something to eat
outside the takeout
and someone would give you a paper bag with food

an open poem to fans of fiona apple.
we fled from battles that matter
into the welcoming arms of the artist
finding solace in someone else's self-centricity
deserters all
but what sanctuary in her serenade!
siren-priestess, masked, covert,
through rosy shield and misfortunes played
she makes holy the mysteries of hurt
her song smothers us listlessly
as she breathes a tiresome litany
of complaints crafted achingly, intentionally
festering the wounds that bind us
the distance between us falsely shortened
we think ourselves known
in league with what's below
the surface of things shimmer as she sings
and by common discontent, we flow
but the light belies the danger; my words mark:
mounting waves in a dark boundless sea
consume the heedless lark
lured too low on its journey
too close to see our fall
we've become nietzche's decadents
while the dreadful circuit turns
ever deeper: chart and compass a mirror
spiraling down, the feeble wake burns
we run aground
in the end we are refugees,
in bad faith
proud of our flight
and with pounding fists we might
create a din
to wallow in
but neither grieve defeat
nor savor victory
veterans of nothing
but inward seeing
pity in infamy

crowding the cavern, bard need not beware:
weight lifted from robbery doubles ascension

Belting melodies from the heart

Training this body just to say
What my brain already knows
It will show me the way

You know how it goes
I'd be receiver and transmitter
Of music from the unknown to every human headphone
From ether to ears, harmony of the spheres
No intermediaries. No interference.
No more thinking how to play
Training this body just to say

With Nothing left to do

looking outside my window
i can't tell if it's day or night (alt: inside the eternal night)
this darkness always surrounds me
and there's no end in sight
we are the ranks of the departed,
we never finish what we've started,
alive but not living,
kind but not forgiving,
because there is no place for us
there is no place for us
the stillness speaks
praying for five o'clock
i count the hours
prostrated and locked
one day a crack in the wall appears
and the shadow is gone with all of your fears
we are the ranks of the departed,
we never finish what we've started,
alive but not living,
kind but not forgiving,
because there is no place for us
there is no place for us
lying in my cave
the shadow's dance is done
the stone covers my window
with the darkness i am one

You've got it tied all wrong
If you're really depressed
You don't sing a song like that song
That's not loaded, is it?
I've been talking to you for five minutes
And you haven't fired a shot
So, is this all you've got?
Don't even try to make things better
It's their fault anyway, and it's too late
You're keeping it real; Don't change your ways
Keep on wearing black on sunny days
You'll need a higher dosage than that, chief.
I know the president's got you down
You hate corporate america
And war is all around
Don't even try to make things better
It's their fault anyway, and it's too late
You're keeping it real; Don't change your ways
Keep on wearing black on sunny days
Tell me again how the world is so fucked up
Tell me that I owe you something
No, you don't have to explain
I know you're really suffering
Today is shining brightly
So put on a vacant stare and block out the light
Close the windows and fire up the oven

rising up, up away from here, crossing into the stratosphere
dispassionate and far; he is silent, he is clear
maybe i'm crazy because i see what he sees
it's more dead than alive, this place we call home
so many souls that have gone before
are they among us? nobody knows
i went to the mountain to search for the truth
i found nothing, lost my youth
and i'm changed
i'm changed

did this really happen? i can't trust my mind. the moment slipped away, leaving me behind
am i one of them? i can't tell what's real anymore

nights gave way to this morning light?
Time's fire burns brightly righteous heat
These trials make us complete
As long as we can feel we can fight
Verse
Sometime long ago we were young under the sun
Bright in our beginnings, a world to be won
Shining too sharply under shadows, enshrouded
And our stories
seasons
though separate, became one
Chorus
What silent
bitter
winters made these summer songs so sweet?
What dark
silent
nights gave way to this morning light?
Time's fire burns brightly righteous heat
As long as we can feel we can fight
Bridge
There is no
Good without Bad
Sun without Moon
One without Many
Song without Tune
As the wheel of time turns life green to
fictions
photos grey
New life grows as the old goes away
We are born again as new creations, the children of our tribulations
This is the way
This is the way
Verse
Only when the wind blows and the snows melt into the earth
Will we be happy; we will be free; How we were meant to be
Chorus
What silent
bitter
winters made these summer songs so sweet?
What dark
silent
nights gave way to this morning light?
Time's fire burns brightly righteous heat
As long as we can feel we can fight
Coda
You said, 'What would we be without music?' My answer is this song.
